# Build Log

What follows will hopefully be an unpretty flow of ideas that will eventually come together to form an interactive wall. Fingers crossed :)

## Goals

Some key goals for the project.
The finished project will
  * Communicates the sessions available
  * flexible, and easy to upgrade and change around in the future
  * be supported by full documentation, allowing for anyone to create their own interactive wall
  * be installed at Fab Lab WGTN

The interactive wall will be allow people to learn more about Fab Lab WGTN in an engaging yet comfortable way.

## User Journey

One of this projects main goals is to create a wall that allows people to learn more about Fab Lab WGTN in an engaging yet comfortable way.
Here at Fab Lab WGTN we see a lot of new people every year and these people, don't know the correct way to get involved and enter the space. The interactive wall aims to bridge that gap by laying out visibly some of the things you can do in the space.

## Paper Prototyping

Above is some images of the paper prototyping we did.
Both Liz and I quite like the layout shown in the photo as it can be nicely divided into different sections.

### Button Style

Trying out different button styles.

The small dark circles are the pushable buttons.

A more interesting layout, much less grid like.

To add more information I could add a flap system.

# Form Development

When I came into the project the initial concept was to have individual button modules each hung on the wall connected via wires connecting back to a main hub also hung on the wall. I spent time designing for this concept until I came to a wall of to many issues with this concept and we decided to reconceptualise how the interactive wall would look and be hung on the wall.

## Parameters

We needed to establish the parameters of the design in order to reconceptualise how this wall is going to materialise.

- Fits within 4000x2100mm
- Can easily add, remove and, rearrange the buttons in future (modularity)
- A tidy way to manage the many wires involved
-

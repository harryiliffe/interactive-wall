# Form Development

When I came into the project the initial concept was to have individual button modules each hung on the wall connected via wires connecting back to a main hub also hung on the wall.

Harry's form development work:

I spent time sketching and designing for this concept (insert images) but I kept running into problems.

- How would each individual object hand on the wall?
- How will we manage cables?

There were too many issues with this concept (the main issue being how would it be hung on the wall) and we decided to re-conceptualise after a very helpful meeting with Craig.

## Parameters

We needed to establish the parameters of the design in order to re-conceptualise how this wall is going to materialise.

- Fits within 4000x2100mm
- Can easily add, remove and, rearrange the buttons in future (modularity)
- A tidy way to manage the many wires involved
- Can be moved and relocated
- Considers future maintenance issues

## Final form beginnings

These parameters sparked the idea for the interactive wall to become a peg board with reposition-able modules.
